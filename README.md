# Retrospect - A Retro Gaming Web Design Entry
This is my web design entry for the **Pixel Fusion Web Design Competition** where I won as the **Champion** and **Best User Experience** last October 7, 2024. Following the classic pixel games and retro gaming themes, the designs draws inspiration from the aesthetics of childhood gaming. The website features a short introduction, featured game and character, gallery, and top 5 retro games to achieve the desired theme.
