# Retrospect - A Retro Gaming Web Design Entry
This is my web design entry for the **Pixel Fusion: Interlacing Art and Technology Web Design Competition** where I was awarded **Champion** and **Best User Experience** on October 7, 2024.
The design follows the classic pixel games and retro gaming themes, drawing inspiration from the aesthetics of childhood gaming.

The 4-hour web design competition was organized by **Code Geeks** and held at Holy Angel University. Most of the images and graphics were provided during the competition, while some may have been sourced from the Internet. These assets were used under fair use for educational and non-commercial purposes, and I do not claim ownership of them.
